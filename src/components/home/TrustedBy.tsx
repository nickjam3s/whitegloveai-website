I was initially apprehensive about this new project—there was a lot at stake—but within 15 minutes of rollout, it was clear the product and service were both impeccable. Even with the complexity of our setup, WhitegloveAI addressed every detail flawlessly. The feedback from our attendees was overwhelmingly positive: 94% of survey responders said they were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with the AI translation service. That is a huge win!"`,

They supported our Traffic department in understanding service requests and building automated workflows that now provide valuable data analytics. Their agile project management approach gave us visibility into the product early on and allowed for continuous input, ensuring the final solution met our needs.

What really stood out was how reusable the model is—we're now able to apply it to other departments that handle citizen inquiries. The WhitegloveAI team was easy to work with, highly responsive, and their Texas-based location made collaboration even smoother. Based on this successful engagement, we've already brought them in on a new project with another department. They've truly proven themselves as a trusted and innovative partner."`,
